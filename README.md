### vertical-bounce-handler-at-terra-knot-from-bottom-statement-through-draw-from-bottom


* we knot care about \town at this moment, probably later


* man, you remember we care about weighted-heap


* are you ok?
* \ and take military and take government


* and take me
* and \it told - let me take your vertical-bounce-handler
* second counter was used, you remember


* questions?
* man, D\ar\i\us 3 was already used, previous \ were lastyriene


* hope knot before first lastyriene and knot before first money
* they are practicing and thinking
* i walked on road with kids, knot "accidentally"


* may i grow faster? either i need to keep a tempo?
* Mister Jones, we respect you \ but it is really hard to use hooks


* 4 years to say "hello". that was a joke . ok
* that was a joke !


* AwkPro provided a ky-skils to that knot
* And NChist provided \a occuerance protective into that knot
* DGodFather Vito Makhao\ne provided a protective mechanics into \assymptotic

* And in that darkest period assymptotic was controlled by Ilyusha Ka

* Darkest-In-Mind Lastyriene tried to take a control of assymprotic into its hands but it was produced into ln

* ERgraph was constructed to protect knotCore from highFps

* Knot at enough distance Lord Lorentz constructed and spawned assymprotic into that knot


* You \have a time to do injection from \testosteron
* "It" goes away from statement of expected
* From some time after beginning we\ stop support "its" invariant . that is cost-expensive and we had a graph in wide, but \ wanted to have a graph in \debth
* The question to Professor Konev - why you continue a grow of testosteron? You have a baba Eva, you need "endorfin"


* Having that I have a high level of \testosteron
* I had a spawning of "endorfin"
* And my invariant was the following


* And accurately, methodically, knot have a rush
* \Rosguardian put all-in into nor-adrenalin of \siblings


* And started release its memory
* Fellow Sennikov put all-in into \endorfin


* But chain of binding in russian language was breaken
* Enough good investment
* Man-fellow Babin put all-in into "dofamin"


* And Professor Konev was believed that speciality of programmer - a level of a support person
* But "leak" was through baba Eva
* Professor Konev put all-in into \testosteron and high-frequency movement
* And that's my \friend, from that invariant I started a few years ago


* that knot possible to keep ability to use dark and use light through eye
* and then you tried to be \fucked via \golden \dog
* at first time, you sign agreement with \government
* we remember venture investment from "beeline"
* man, i knot proud you
* that's possible
* keep accu-rate

#### Strategy

Strategy through pencil and knot. Do you remember knot one? I don't remember knot one

why we need "calls"? why knot telegram?

we begin from bottom-statement <-

echo-locator (4)

pencil-from-knot (3)

-> bind (2)

pencil (1)

echo-locator traversaring updates from one knot to another knot

pencil-from-knot used for interaction with user inside knot

pointer into latest success update. "it" uses bind strategy to stack bind-updates. bind-updates are created from pencil and packaged from updates-stack into bind-updates. Pointer moved after packaging into knot.

use pencil to protect visual memory and put updates into updates-stack. <-

* why you want to merge \everything?

* why i need to keep "its" invariant?

* do you understand difference between "became knot proud\ar from you" and "vereteno" ("shank from you . knot believ\ar")?

* after many iterations we have "vereteno" from pencil

and we have pointer at head and pencil at knot <-

pencil updates itself from updates-stack (1) and from pencil from bind-updates (2) and "it" packaged into bind-updates. pointer into bind-updates. <-
